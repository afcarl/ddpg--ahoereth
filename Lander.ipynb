Reward for moving from the top of the screen to landing pad and zero speed is about $100..140$ points. If lander moves away from landing pad it loses reward back. Episode finishes if the lander crashes or comes to rest, receiving additional -100 or +100 points. Each leg ground contact is $+10$. Firing main engine is $-0.3$ points each frame. Solved is 200 points. Landing outside landing pad is possible. Fuel is infinite, so an agent can learn to fly and then land on its first attempt. Action is two real values vector from $-1$ to $+1$. First controls main engine, $-1..0$ off, $0..+1$ throttle from $50\\%$ to $100\\%$ power. Engine can't work with less than $50\\%$ power. Second value $-1.0..-0.5$ fire left engine, $+0.5..+1.0$ fire right engine, $-0.5..0.5$ off.\n",

The straight forward approach for implementing this would be to use `collections.deque`, but sampling from such a queue (as the name maybe already shows...) is [expensive](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity). Therefore we implement a custom memory class which makes use of a basic list and implements the element limit through a pointer which dictates which element is to be overwritten on insert."

This stands in contrast to Deep Q Networks (Mnih et al 2015), where the Q network maps the environment's state to a vector of Q values, one for each action. This is because in our case the Q network is not used to determine which action to take (DQN uses a deterministic `argmax` policy on the Q value vector), but only to *criticize* whatever action the actor network decides on taking.\n",

    "> For the exploration noise process we used temporally correlated noise in order to explore well in physical environments that have momentum. We used an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (Uhlenbeck & Ornstein, 1930) with θ = 0.15 and σ = 0.2. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process models the velocity of a Brownian particle with friction, which results in temporally correlated values centered around 0."
